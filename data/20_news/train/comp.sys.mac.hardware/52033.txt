Subject: PhoneNet questions

My school is setting up a new network with both Macs and Apple II's.  I'm
used to ethernet, and don't know much about LocalTalk.  Two things:  first,
in Mac Warehouse, they have PowerUser network connectors, and the caption
leads you to believe that you can plug them into the phone lines in the
building and have them work.  Is this true?  I've seen it done by running
separate phone cords, but never with real lines.  Second, if that does work,
could you use a modem hooked up to that same line while the network was
active?  Help would be greatly appreciated.  BTW-running separate phone line 
is out of the question, the network will  VERRY spread o.
